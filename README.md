Scripts contained in this repository will perform a series of disparity methods.
The scripts are permently on Dryad (http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.d380g) and are assocaited with the paper "Smith, A. J., Rosario, M. V., Eiting T. P., Dumont E. R., 2014. Joined at the hip: linked characters and the study of missing data in studies of disparity. Evolution. doi: 10.1111/evo.12435"

At the moment this script calculates Sum of Ranges, Product of Ranges, Sum of Variances, and Product of Variances. The method is based on Wills et al. 1994 method.

The example file is from Luo et al. 2007.
